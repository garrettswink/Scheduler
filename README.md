# Scheduler App

## Dev Note
In writing the Javascript code for this  assignment, I referenced the following YouTube tutorials:

    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm6py49QNto
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPU6gOctNvM

My process involved reviewing, reverse engineering, and modifying code blocks with the assistance of JS.Day, Bootstap, and Jquery documentation.

I have also included heavy documentation for refernce and use in future projects. Likewise, I found commenting the full code flow extremely helpful in better understanding JavaScript function syntax, API fetching, and some nascant data manipulation.

Lastly, in prepping this for submission, I noticed that the color change function is not working. Considering my tardiness, I want to get this in for an initial evalution; but any hints or tips on how I might troubleshoot resolving this issue would be terrific.
